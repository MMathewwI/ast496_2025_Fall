If you have an existing `conda` or `conda` installation, skip to Step 3.

1. Begin by installing Miniforge for your operating system from here: https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file (SCROLL DOWN TO THE INSTALL SECTION ON GITHUB)


2. If this is your first time installing `conda`, open a terminal (you should have taken ASTR310, so I'm going to assume you know how to do this), and run:
> conda init

3. Run the following commands in sequence
> conda create -n astr496
> conda activate astr496
> conda install python=3 numpy scipy astropy jupyter matplotlib scikit-learn pandas

This will prompt you to install several other packages. Hit yes.
